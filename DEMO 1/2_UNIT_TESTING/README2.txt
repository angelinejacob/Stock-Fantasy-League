7-#ADMIN: get information of all users
8-#System: get data for stock given ticker

Included are snapshots of the database before and after the update of users and players

-------Whats in the Output File?-------

The output file shows the RAW data from the update. In our code, we return information back to the system so that it understands what is going on. When we create users, we return the user ID for the system (uid). For and 'get' function, it returns a json string of the information from the database. For 'updates', we return a string for successfully updating. Lastly, for stock data, we return a json string of the information that was grabbed from the AlphaVantage API. 

-------EXTRA NOTES-------

Our code was modified slightly to allow user creation without the use of google authentication. In order to run the code locally, google authentication must be turned off. The functionality is the exact same. The only modification was to enter the fields that google would provide us, manually.
